<p>When we talk about the Biase and Variance tradeoff we are talking about the error in the model and these are calculated on multiple(infinte) train and test splits of the data as these measures are statical in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Bias :</strong></p>

<p>Bias is the difference between the average prediction of all the models and the expected Label. The Dataset is also obtained from the a distribution \(P(X,y)\) so for a feature vectors X we a distribution of y which comes from \(P(\frac{Y}{X})\) which means we have to get the expected label from the distribution \(P(\frac{Y}{X})\).</p>

<p>The reason for High bias could be that the model is too simple. Being High bias means that the model is not able to capture the general trend in the data. Low Bias means that the model is able to capture the general trend in the data and is a good situtation to be in.</p>

<p><strong>Variance :</strong></p>

<p>Let’s say we have 50 models and we have to calculate the variance of the models. We calculate the variance of the model by calculating the variability in the output of the models with the formula of variance.</p>

<p>High variance means that the model is not able to generalize well on the data and is overfitting. This mean that if the model is trained on a different the predictions would change drastically. Low variance means that the model is able to generalize well on the data and is a good situation to be in.</p>

<p><strong>Tradeoff :</strong></p>

<p>Pursuing low bias requires increasing complexity which increases variance as now the model has room to overfit the data, and pursuing low variance requires decreasing complexity which increases bias.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bhoomeendra</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visit]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SVM</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/2023-06-04-SVM.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SVM" /><published>2023-06-04T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-06-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/SVM</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/2023-06-04-SVM.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="svm-for-classification">SVM for Classification</h3>

<p>Let’s say we have +ve and -ve classes what SVM tries to do is find a hyperplane such that it maximizes the margin between the +ve and -ve classes.</p>

<p><strong>Geometric Intuition</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Convex hull of the +ve and -ve classes.</li>
  <li>Find the shortest line that connects the convex hulls of the +ve and -ve classes.</li>
  <li>The line that is perpendicular to the shortest line is the separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the +ve and -ve classes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="formulation">Formulation</h3>
<p>We assume a separating hyperplane of the form \(w^Tx + b = 0\) where \(w\) is the normal vector to the hyperplane and \(b\) is the bias. We assume that the +ve class is on one side of the hyperplane at distance d and the -ve class is on the other side of the hyperplane at a distance c these are the margins and are parallel to the separating hyperplan. We can write the equation of the margins as follows:</p>

\[w^Tx + b = d\]

\[w^Tx + b = -c\]

<p>we can divide the first equation by d and the second equation by c as in doesn’t change the formulation. Now Our goal is to maximize the margin between the margins. Which would be the same as minimizing \(\frac{2}{\left \| w \right \|}\).</p>

<p>Hence the Objective function becomes:</p>

\[w^*,b^* = \underset{w,b}{argmax}\left (\frac{2}{||w||}\right )\]

\[s.t \:\:\: y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1  \:\:\: \forall i\]

<p>The important part is that the data points which have to be linearly separable for the above formulation to work. But in real world data is not linearly separable so we introduce the concept of slack variables. The slack variables are the distance of the data points from the margins. The objective function becomes:</p>

\[w^*,b^* = \underset{w,b}{argmin}\left (\frac{||w||}{2}\right ) + C \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}\varepsilon_i\]

\[s.t \:\:\: y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1 - \varepsilon_i  \:\:\: \forall i\]

<p>If we look at the formulation we have added a penalty for error in the earlier formulation error was not possible because of the constraints of the formulation which is equivalent to C being infinity. Now we have a tradeoff between the margin and the error. If we increase C we are penalizing the error more and if we decrease C we are penalizing the margin more.</p>

<p>We will convert the above formulation into a Lagrangian formulation and solve it using the Lagrangian multipliers. The Lagrangian formulation is as follows:</p>

\[L(w,b,\varepsilon,\alpha,\mu) = \frac{||w||^{2}}{2} + C \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n}\varepsilon_i - \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_i(y_i(w^Tx_i + b) - 1 + \varepsilon_i) - \sum_{i}^{n}\mu_i\varepsilon_i\]

<p>We take the partial derivative of the Lagrangian formulation with respect to w,b and \(\varepsilon\) and equate them to 0. We get the following equations:</p>

\[w = \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_iy_ix_i\]

\[0 = \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_iy_i\]

\[\alpha_i = C - \mu_i\]

<p>We substitute the above equations in the Lagrangian formulation and we get the following formulation:</p>

\[L(w,b,\varepsilon,\alpha,\mu) = \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{n}\sum_{j}^{n}\alpha_i\alpha_jy_iy_jx_i^Tx_j\]

\[s.t \:\:\: \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_iy_i = 0\]

\[\alpha_i \geq 0\]

\[\mu_i \geq 0\]

\[\varepsilon_i \geq 0\]

\[0 = \sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_iy_i\]

\[0 = \sum_{i}^{n}\mu_i\varepsilon_i\]

<p>The \(L(w,b,\varepsilon,\alpha,\mu)\) looks the same as the formulation for the dual problem of the Hard SVM the only differece is the constrains. The constrains \(\alpha_i \geq 0\)  ,  \(\mu_i \geq 0\) and \(\alpha_i = C - \mu_i\) we combine these constrains and we get \(0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C\).</p>

<h3 id="model-prediction">Model Prediction</h3>

<p>One’s we have identified the support vectors we can calculate the prediction on test as follows:</p>

\[y = sign(\sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_iy_ix_i^Tx + b)\]

<p>As only the support vectors contribute to the prediction we only need to store the support vectors and the corresponding \(\alpha\) values.</p>

<p>The other important thing to note is that the dot product \(x_i^Tx_j\) can be replaced by a kernel function \(K(x_i,x_j)\).</p>

<h3 id="kernel-trick">Kernel Trick</h3>

<p>The kernel trick is a technique in which we can replace the dot product \(x_i^Tx_j\) with a kernel function \(K(x_i,x_j)\) which is a function which takes two vectors as input and outputs a scalar. The kernel function should satisfy the following properties:</p>

\[K(x_i,x_j) = K(x_j,x_i)\]

\[K(x_i,x_j) \geq 0\]

\[\sum_{i}^{n}\sum_{j}^{n}c_ic_jK(x_i,x_j) \geq 0\]

<p>i.e. Symmetric, Positive Semi-definite.</p>

<p>The kernel function can be used to calculate the similarity between two vectors in a higher dimensional space without actually calculating the dot product in the higher dimensional space.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<h3 id="kernel-functions">Kernel Functions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Linear Kernel: \(K(x_i,x_j) = x_i^Tx_j\)</li>
  <li>Polynomial Kernel: \(K(x_i,x_j) = (x_i^Tx_j + 1)^d\)</li>
  <li>Gaussian Kernel(rbf kernel): \(K(x_i,x_j) = exp(-\frac{ \left \|  x_i - x_j \right \| ^2}{2\sigma^2})\)</li>
</ol>

<p>Gaussian Kernel is the most commonly used kernel function. The hyperparameter \(\sigma\) is the bandwidth of the kernel function.This is seen as \(\left \|  x_i - x_j \right \| ^2\) is the squared distance between the two vectors. The hyperparameter \(\sigma\) controls the kernel function. If \(\sigma\) is small then the kernel function is very sensitive to the distance between the two vectors (only the vectors which have a distance almost zero will be considered similar) and if \(\sigma\) is large then the kernel function is not very sensitive to the distance between the two vectors. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/radial-basis-function-rbf-kernel-the-go-to-kernel-acf0d22c798a">Visit</a></p>

By sampling with replacement, some observations may be repeated in each \(D_{i}\).</p>

<p>These are the original, bootstrap, and out-of-bag datasets.</p>

<p>Original dataset \(D\) of size n. Let say we have a bootstrap sample \(D_{i}\) of size n′. Then we would have \(n - n′\) OOB(out of bag) here n′ is the number of unique observations in \(D_{i}\).</p>

<p>Now we train the model on \(D_{i}\) and test it on the OOB dataset. We repeat this process for all the bootstrap samples and then we aggregate the results of all the models to get the final model.</p>

<p>In Bagging we are trying to reduce the variance of the model by training the model on different datasets and aggregating the results. Bagging is also called bootstrap aggregation.</p>

<p>Each learner is high variance, low bias. Aggregating the learners reduces the variance of the ensemble. The reason for variance reduction is that individual learners would have a large variance but when we aggregate the results of all the learners the variance would be reduced. And as the bias of the learners is low the bias of the ensemble would also be low but can be more than the bias of the individual learners.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bagging is kind of works as a regularization method as the objective of regularization is to reduce the variance (Prevent Overfitting) of the model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The predictions of the model are more robust (More confident) as we are aggregating the results of multiple models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bagging can be used for both classification and regression.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bagging take up a lot of memory as we are training multiple models. This can be a problem when we are working with large datasets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Loss of interpretability as we are aggregating the results of multiple models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For weak learner with high bias, bagging will also carry high bias into its aggregated model.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="interview-questions">Interview Questions</h3>

<p>Discuss how bagging handles imbalanced datasets and its impact on the performance of the ensemble?</p>

<p>Bagging can help in cases of data imbalace as we are sampling the data with replacement. This means that the minority class can be sampled more and if needed we can also oversample the minority class. This will help in improving the performance of the model.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bhoomeendra</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a standard training set \(D\) of size n, bagging generates m new training sets \(D_{i}\), each of size n′, by sampling from \(D\) uniformly and with replacement.

<p><strong>Agglomerative:</strong> This is a “bottom-up” approach: Each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.</p>

<p>We start with each observation in its own cluster. Then, we merge the two closest clusters, and repeat until only one cluster remains.</p>

<p>Merging Clusters: How do we define the distance between two clusters?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Closest points (Single Link): Compute all pairwise distances between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the closest distance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furthest points (Complete Link): Compute all pairwise distances between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the furthest distance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average distance (Average Link): Compute all pairwise distances between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the average distance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ward’s method: Merge the two clusters such that the increase in the SSE (sum of squared errors) is minimized. This is the same objective function that k-means tries to minimize!(Need to understand this)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Divisive:</strong> This is a “top-down” approach: All observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy. We start with all observations in the same cluster and calculate the distance matrix and after that we form a MST (Minimum spanning tree) and then we cut the tree at edges that have the largest distance till no edges are left.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bhoomeendra</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hierarchical Clustering is of two types which are Divisive and Agglomerative.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">K-Means</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/2023-06-04-KMeans.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="K-Means" /><published>2023-06-04T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-06-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/KMeans</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ML/jekyll/2023-06-04-KMeans.html"><![CDATA[<p>K means is clustering algorithm where k denotes the number of clusters which we define before hand. The algorithm works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Randomly initialize k cluster centers (select k points).</li>
  <li>Assign each point to the closest cluster center.</li>
  <li>Recompute the cluster centers by taking the mean of all the points in the new cluster.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (When we don’t see a lot of points change clusters).</li>
</ol>

<p>The above solution is a local optimum and not a global optimum. Mathamatically best cluster centers are the ones that minimize the following objective function:</p>

\[\underset{c}{min} \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x \in c_i}^{n} \left \| x - \mu_i \right \|^{2}\]

<p>Where \(c\) is the set of clusters, \(c_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) cluster, \(\mu_i\) is the mean of the \(i^{th}\) cluster and \(n\) is the number of points in the \(i^{th}\) cluster. This is a NP hard problem and hence we use the above algorithm to find a local optimum.</p>

<p>Generally we run the above algorithm multiple times with different initializations and choose the one with the lowest objective function value.</p>

<h3 id="important-points">Important Points</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>K means is sensitive to the initialization of the cluster centers hence we have kmeans++ in which we first pick a centroid and then the points are assigned a probability of begin selected as centroid based on the distance for the current point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>K means is sensitive to outliers as the mean is sensitive to outliers to address this we have k medoids in which we use the median instead of the mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>K means is sensitive to the number of clusters we have in the data. To address this we have silhouette score which is a measure of how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The <strong>silhouette score</strong> is calculated as follows: \(s = \frac{b - a}{max(a,b)}\) Where \(a\) is the mean distance between a point and all other points in the same cluster and \(b\) is the mean distance between a point and all other points in the next nearest cluster. The silhouette score is between -1 and 1. A score of 1 means that the point is very similar to its own cluster and very dissimilar to other clusters. A score of 0 means that the point is on the boundary of two clusters. A score of -1 means that the point is assigned to the wrong cluster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the densities of the clusters are different then k means will not work well. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that can handle clusters with different densities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-globular clusters are clusters that are not spherical in shape. K means will not work well on non globular clusters.</p>

The new basis are called principal components. The first principal component is the direction along which the variance of the data is maximized. The second principal component is the direction orthogonal to the first principal component along which the variance of the data is maximized. The third principal component is the direction orthogonal to the first two principal components along which the variance of the data is maximized. And so on.</p>

<p>Once we have all the basis vectors, we can project the data onto the first few principal components to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The variance captured by the principal components is proportional to the eigenvalues of the corresponding eigenvectors.</p>

<p>We want to find the direction along which the variance of the data is maximized. The variance of the data along a direction is given by the following equation:</p>

\[\underset{u^{T}.u=1}{max} \; Var(u_{1}^T X)\]

<p>Given that \(X\) is mean centered with respect to each feature, we can expand the variance as follows:</p>

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = (u_{1}^T X)(u_{1}^T X)^{T}\]

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = u_{1}^{T}Su_{1}\]

<p>Now we want to find a \(u_{1}\) such that the variance is maximized. We can use the Lagrangian formulation to solve this problem. The Lagrangian formulation is as follows:</p>

\[L(u_{1},\lambda) = u_{1}Su_{1} - \lambda(u_{1}^T u_{1} - 1)\]

<p>We take the partial derivative of the Lagrangian formulation with respect to \(u_{1}\) and equate it to 0. We get the following equation:</p>

\[Su_{1} = \lambda u_{1}\]

<p>This is the equation for eigenvalue and eigenvector.</p>

<p>How does variance relate to eigenvalues? We can expand the variance as follows:</p>

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = u_{1}^{T}Su_{1}\]

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = u_{1}^{T}(\lambda_{1} u_{1})\]

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = \lambda_{1} u_{1}^{T}u_{1}\]

\[Var(u_{1}^T X) = \lambda_{1}\]

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Because we do eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix, and by defination covariance matrix we have to do mean centering of the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we have a large dataset we can use the following trick to do PCA. We can use the following equation to calculate the covariance matrix:\(\frac{1}{n}X^TX\)
as the resulting covariance matrix will be a square matrix of size \(dxd\) where \(d\) is the number of features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once we have the eigenvectors all the data points can be projected onto the new basis and only the cofficients of the new basis will be stored. This is how we reduce the dimensionality of the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PCA can be used to remove noise as the components with low variance can be removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most variance might not mean the most meaningful for instance lets say we are classifying dog breads then if we remove features with low variance we might remove the features that are important for classification.</p>

    <p>PCA is a linear transformation and orthogonal hence it can only capture linear relationships.</p>

<p>Logistic regression is linear regression over the log odds or logit of the probability of input belonging to a class. The model choice in logistic regression is the logits of the probability are linearly dependent on the independent variable. But the problem we solve with this is the <strong>classification problem</strong>. The output of the model is the probability of the input belonging to a class.
\(logit(p) = log(\frac{p}{p+1})\)</p>

<p>The model is as follows:</p>

\[logit(p) = w^Tx + b\]

\[p = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(w^Tx+b)}}\]

\[p = \sigma(w^Tx+b)\]

<p>What sigmoid does is that it constrains the output between 0 and 1. This is one of the definitions of logistic regression.</p>
<h3 id="geometric-formulation">Geometric Formulation</h3>
<p>We can have a geometric explanation as well. We start with a classification boundary which is \(w^Tx +b\). We want a w such that \(\forall i \; y_i(w^Tx_i+b)&gt;=0\) i.e the predicted class and the actual class are of the same sign for the product term to be positive but using a objective function which maximizes \(\sum y_i(w^Tx_i+b)\) has some limitation. The problem is that when an outlier comes, the loss value will be very high, and the model will try to fit the outlier. To solve the problem sigmoid function is used as it constrains the values between 0 and 1 which limits the impact of outlier.</p>

<h3 id="formulation-of-the-loss-function">Formulation of the loss function</h3>
<p>The purpose of the loss function is to maximize the probability of the correct class. Logistic regression is a binary classification problem; hence we have two classes, 0 and 1. Higher probability is associated with class 1, and low probability is associated with class 0. The objective function is as follows:</p>

\[L = \prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{y_i}(1-p_i)^{1-y_i} \; where \; p = \sigma(w^Tx+b)\]

\[L = \prod_{i=1}^n \sigma(w^Tx_i+b)^{y_i}(1-\sigma(w^Tx_i+b))^{1-y_i}\]

<p>As all the values are always positive, taking log will not affect the optimization problem. Also will help with numerical stability as the probability values are very small and the product will be even smaller. Hence the loss function is as follows:</p>

\[L = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i log(\sigma(w^Tx_i+b)) + (1-y_i)log(1-\sigma(w^Tx_i+b))\]

\[w^* = argmax_w L(w)\]

<p>But still, we have a problem which is that if when w tends to infinity, the we would have the maximum value of the objective function, which is not what we want. Hence we add a regularization term to the objective function. The objective function is as follows:</p>

\[L =  \sum_{i=1}^n y_i log(\sigma(w^Tx_i+b)) + (1-y_i)log(1-\sigma(w^Tx_i+b)) + \lambda ww^T\]

<h3 id="interview-questions">Interview Questions</h3>

<p>Should we normailze the data before giving it to the logistice regression algorithim?</p>

<p>Yes we should normalize the data it would give use two problems first is the</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Interpretiblity of the weights/coffecient</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Interpretiblity of the weights/coffecient as because the coffecient indicats the impact on prediction when we have unit change in the feature but feats with differect scale can not be compaired with each other once we normalize (Min Max) or standardize (\(\mu =0 , \sigma =1\)) the data becomes unitless hence comparative interpretblity is possible which could indicate geniune feature importance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convergence of SGD</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The magnitude of gradient of depends on the values of the inputs which we can see for both squared loss and cross entorpy loss which mean that feature with higher values wil have bigger gradient and features with smaller values will have smaller gradient hence convergence would led to ossilation but when the data is normalized such problem is prevented.</li>
