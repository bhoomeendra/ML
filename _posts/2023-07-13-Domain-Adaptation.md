CIFAR Data with random labels and still the model is able to get high accuracy. This is because the model is able to memorize the data.

Domain shifts/ Dataset Bias - The model is trained on one dataset and tested on another dataset. This is a problem in real world. Example : We train a self driving car on the data collected from one city and then we test it on another city. The model will not perform well on the new city.

Learning from simultion to real world is a problem.
