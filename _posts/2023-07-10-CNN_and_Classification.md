Weight intialization

Regularization
 Early stop 
 
 drop out 
 
 weight decay 
 
 data augmentation 

 etc

Convolutional Neural Networks

Simple MLP has 2 many parameters hence computationlly expensive and prone to overfitting. Does not take into account the spatial structure of the data.

Pooling
Stride
Padding
Window size

Formula of output size of convolutional layer
Channels ?
How it works on volume ?
what is 1x1 convolution and why is it used?
The idea of convolution is the ability to learn filter.
