We select k nearest neighbors and assign the class to the new data point based on the majority of the class of the k nearest neighbors. The distance between the data points is calculated using the Euclidean distance. The problem with this approach is that even when the data points are far away they are considered neighbors. To address this we have weighted k nearest neighbors in which we assign weights to the neighbors based on the distance. The other problem is that for every data point we have calculated the distance to all the other data points. To address this we have k-d trees which are binary trees that partition the data points into regions.
