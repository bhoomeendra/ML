K means is clustering algorithm where k denotes the number of clusters which we define before hand. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Randomly initialize k cluster centers (select k points).
2. Assign each point to the closest cluster center.
3. Recompute the cluster centers by taking the mean of all the points in the new cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (When we don't see a lot of points change clusters).

The above solution is a local optimum and not a global optimum. Mathamatically best cluster centers are the ones that minimize the following objective function:

$$ \underset{c}{min} \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{x \in c_i}^{n} \left \| x - \mu_i \right \|^{2} $$

Where $$c$$ is the set of clusters, $$c_i$$ is the $$i^{th}$$ cluster, $$\mu_i$$ is the mean of the $$i^{th}$$ cluster and $$n$$ is the number of points in the $$i^{th}$$ cluster. This is a NP hard problem and hence we use the above algorithm to find a local optimum.

Generally we run the above algorithm multiple times with different initializations and choose the one with the lowest objective function value.

### Important Points
1. K means is sensitive to the initialization of the cluster centers hence we have kmeans++ in which we first pick a centroid and then the points are assigned a probability of begin selected as centroid based on the distance for the current point.

2. K means is sensitive to outliers as the mean is sensitive to outliers to address this we have k medoids in which we use the median instead of the mean.

3. K means is sensitive to the number of clusters we have in the data. To address this we have silhouette score which is a measure of how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The __silhouette score__ is calculated as follows: $$ s = \frac{b - a}{max(a,b)} $$ Where $$a$$ is the mean distance between a point and all other points in the same cluster and $$b$$ is the mean distance between a point and all other points in the next nearest cluster. The silhouette score is between -1 and 1. A score of 1 means that the point is very similar to its own cluster and very dissimilar to other clusters. A score of 0 means that the point is on the boundary of two clusters. A score of -1 means that the point is assigned to the wrong cluster.

4. If the densities of the clusters are different then k means will not work well. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that can handle clusters with different densities. 

5. Non-globular clusters are clusters that are not spherical in shape. K means will not work well on non globular clusters.
